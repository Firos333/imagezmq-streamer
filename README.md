Description:  <br />
Live Vedio straeming using Oencv nd ImageZmq python packages which will detect Faces and hands from the client side and shows live in server side.
We’ll then implement two Python scripts:
A client that will capture frames from a simple webcam
And a server that will take the input frames and run object detection on them using Mobile net Opencv DNN. 

What is ZMQ?
ZeroMQ, or simply ZMQ for short, is a high-performance asynchronous message passing library used in distributed systems.
ZeroMQ specifically focuses on high throughput and low latency applications — which is exactly how you can frame live video streaming
This is highly inspred by [Pyimagesearch's](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2019/04/15/live-video-streaming-over-network-with-opencv-and-imagezmq/) Work. and we implemented face and hand detection, which will process in server side
and can get results.
